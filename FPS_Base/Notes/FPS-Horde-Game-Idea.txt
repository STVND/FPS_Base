		Gameplay
			Game Flow
				Wave based
					Between waves is downtime for players to replenish or reposition
					GOW Horde inspired
						Maximum number of rounds or endless?
						As waves increase #ofEnemies increase and tiers increase at set intervals
						As tiers increase new enemy types appear
						
						
			Economy
				Point based
					Dealing damage to mobs generates points
						currently they should be simplified and all damage give the equivalent number of points
						regardless of total amount
						
					Final blow on an enemy grants additional points
						Increases based on enemy tier
				
			Enemies
				Limited number of types to reduce complexity
					tier 1 
						melee enemy
					tier 2
						ranged enemy
					tier 3 
						heavy variations + support enemies
					tier 4
						elemental variations
					tier 5
						boss enemy?
						
						
				Game Director
				
					might be out of scope but implementing an under the hood economy for a simple algorithm to spawn
					new enemies should be looked at. 
					
					All enemies could be spawned at start of round based on JSON file or randomly selected based on 
					enemy tier/difficulty value
					
					(potentially shorter rounds, could be lopsided at the start of the round instead of
					creating interesting experience/scaling difficulty in round)
					
					--OR--
					
					points should be allotted for each tier of enemy
						each enemy is given a difficulty value based on their tier
						AI looks at total difficulty value currently on the map and decides whether to add new enemies
						
					(difficult to implement instead and potentially low gain if it's too complex)
						
					--OR--
					
					simplified enemy counts that are spawned at regular intervals as long as there is 'space' available
					
					(easier to implement, potentially less interesting experience every run but consistent, longer rounds)
				
			Player
				Movement
					Simplified movement
						Basic WASD ✔️
						Looking ✔️
						Combat
						Interaction
							Interact with in-session shop for equipment
							Interact with equipment

				Equipment
					Checkpoints
						(Placeable/Moveable?)
						Able to purchase new weapon
						Able to purchase ammo for reduced price
						Specialty ammo?
							possible better to make mods available
						Able to purchase or replenish basic equipment
						
					Weapons
						Notes:
						Each weapon with an alternative should have a small tradeoff but each weapon in the same class
						should have an equivalent DPS value or near equivalent DPS value with an additional effect.
						
						ie: if one weapon can incur 100 DPS then other weapons in the same class should deal 100 DPS
						or 80 DPS + apply a status effect
						
						Melee
							Knife
							Crowbar
				
						Guns
							short list of weapons 
							GOW limited
							2 primaries to choose from
							2/3 secondaries
				
						Basic throwables
							Grenade
								Explosive
								AOE DOT
					
						Some specials
							Monkey bombs?
							Turrets?
							Placeable Defenses?
				
				
		Basic environment options
			Design notes:
				Go for modular
				Attempt to have 'holdout' points
					'holdout' points shouldn't just be indefinelty holdable
						should have weakpoint or secondary entrance to encourage movement
						
			Casino
			Temple/Jungle
			Zoo
			Museum
